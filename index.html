            I am a national level basketball player and have represented my
            school and state and various tournaments and championships. I
            developed a keen intrest in the sport at an early age of 7 and have

            many heights and taught me a lot about teamwork and sacrifice.

          <p class="camera-skill-para">
            I am a creative. I can never seem to stop creating anything. There
            is always an idea, new picture, or some business idea running
            through my head. I can't help but see a picture before I see words
            on it. I am drawn to color and the beauty around me. I have always
            been drawn to art and design. Growing up I was constantly in my
            sketch book or having some kind of craft happening on the dining
            room table. I am experinced in adobe photoshop and am have also
            contributed to college clubs in the creatives team with my skill.
